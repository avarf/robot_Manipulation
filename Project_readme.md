-   Start using Travis

## Introduction
The goal of this project is the implementation of a catesian controller that can control a manipulator smoothly and pass the welding task of the robocup competition.
The manipulator that will be used for this project is the arm installed on a Kuka Youbot.
When a user wants to move the end effector of a manipulator to a desired position the user needs the joint displacements that are required so the end effector reaches the goal position. A cartesian controller will answer this problem by using different mathematical methods and using forward and backward kinematic solvers.

## Packages
Below packages are being used for implementing this project:

*   ROS - Robot Operating System which enables different packages and nodes to communicate
*   Rviz - 3D visualization tool for ROS
*   KDL - A framework for modelling and implementation of kinematic chains
*   Mas_common_robotic
*   Mas_industrial_robotic


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

For installing the required softwares and packeges the documentaion of each software should be followed.

*   Ubuntu 14.04 [Instaliation Guid](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#0)
*   Ros Indigo [Installiation Guid](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu)
*   Orocos KDL [Installiation Guid](https://github.com/orocos/orocos_kinematics_dynamics/blob/master/orocos_kdl/INSTALL)
*   Mas_common_robotic [Access Link](https://mas.b-it-center.de/gitgate/mas-group/mas_common_robotics)
*   Mas_industrial_robotic [Access Link](https://mas.b-it-center.de/gitgate/mas-group/mas_industrial_robotics)



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get your components running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the test in simulation

Explain how to run the test in simulation

### Break down into smaller steps

Explain what these components do and what the user should see when running them

```
Give an example
```

### And some other components

Explain what these components do and what the user should see when running them

```
Give an example
```

## Running on the robot

Add additional notes about how to run this on youBot
